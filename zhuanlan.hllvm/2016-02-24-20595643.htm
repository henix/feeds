<a href="http://www.cliffc.org/blog/2016/02/19/winds-of-change" data-editable="true" data-title="Winds of Change" class="">Winds of Change - Cliff Click's Blog</a><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Python Go Fast:</strong> Do Unto Python as Thou hast Done Unto Java. I hack the guts of Python; add a high power JIT, a full-fledged low-pause GC, true multi-threading support, i.e. make Python as fast and as parallel as Java (about the same speed as C).  This blog is really a request for an open discussion on this topic.  Is the Python community interested?  How does this get funded?  (uber Kickstarter?)  I’ll only go here with the full support of the core Python committers, and general “feel goods” from the general python community – and I’m hoping to start a discussion.  At this point I’m a premier language implementer, and making Python Go Fast is well within my abilities and past experiences. Take about 2 years &amp; $2M for this effort to be self-sustaining (build all the core new tech and hand it off to other contributors).</li></ul></blockquote><p>困难啊…Cliff大神可能还没体会过CPython社区对“改变”的抗拒orz</p>
