Hyouka finished fourth in the poll, earning it the first review of Fan  Vote Month. Thank you to everyone who voted! Be sure to watch until the  very end for a hint at next week&#39;s review!  </p><p>If you&#39;re feeling particularly generous and want to help me make better  content, here&#39;s a link to my Patreon Page: <a href="https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//www.youtube.com/redirect%3Fq%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.patreon.com%252FUTSreviews%253Fty%253Dh%26event%3Dvideo_description%26redir_token%3DLNLAaTkPm5_3x_jdYCqhAhDEm_18MTU1ODk0MzExOEAxNTU4ODU2NzE4%26v%3DXDBha5uYH08" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.patreon.com/UTSreviews?ty=h</a> </p><p>Please subscribe if you enjoyed the video and feel free to follow me on  Twitter (@UTSreviews). Thanks! </p><p> I use two rating scales for each review. First is the approval rating. A  show will receive one of five approval ratings based on my  recommendation. They are BEST OF THE BEST (for shows I find to be  masterpieces), WATCH (for shows I find really really good and recommend  to everybody), TRY (for shows I find good but not great and will only  recommend to some people), PASS (for shows I did not particularly enjoy  and would not personally recommend), and finally BURN (for the shows  that are so awful they have a special place reserved in hell).</p><p> The other scoring system is a 1-5 rating scale that I essentially give  out arbitrarily based on how good I think the show is. For reference,  here&#39;s how I would rate on a 1-10 scale:  9+ Masterpiece 8 Great 7 Good 6 Average 5 Bad 4 Very Bad 3-1 Burn in Hell  If you have any other questions, comments, or want to rage at me for my  rating of a show, feel free to leave them in the comments section below.  My goal for every review is to give my honest opinion regardless of  whether that matches the majority or not.</p>
