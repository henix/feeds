He understood what scientists enjoyed</p><p>大概就是说，关键在于招聘到牛逼的人，然后他们自己就会主动去做了，而不是说要指令式地让他们做这个做那个。其实嘛，量化交易这个行业，与其说是门生意，不如说是做科研。如果是普通的基金、银行之类的，防火墙之类的措施比较多，各部门之间交流比较少，甚至部门内部由于办公室政治和竞争关系也不会太公开，但如果是按照科研机构式的管理模式就很不一样了。</p><p>所以说，要理解真正牛逼量化对冲基金的管理，不要听那些在国内学校毕业就自己创业开基金的人瞎扯淡，要多看看国外知名量化对冲基金的大佬（如西蒙斯）怎么说......\</p><p>其次是政治方面，<b>西蒙斯是铁杆民主党，他的继任者Robert Mercer是铁杆共和党，他们之间的关系如何呢</b>？</p><p>I’ve talked to him a few times, but he is just very different from me, and I can’t change him,” Simons said......</p><p>In October, Simons, who is the non-executive chairman of Renaissance’s board, encouraged Mercer to resign from his management position at the firm. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/business/robert-mercer-renaissance.html">Mercer did so.</a> Simons said that the decision was practical, not political. Mercer’s growing notoriety was “not so good for morale,” he explained. “One of our very best people had just said he was quitting,” he noted, and “another of the very best people seemed to be on the verge.” Simons checked in with the firm’s members recently, and he believes that he got the data he wanted: morale has improved. “I think I was right,” he said.<br></p><p>大概就是说，西蒙斯找Mercer谈了几次话，但发现无法改变他。但Mercer的极右翼共和党倾向与公司左翼自由化倾向格格不入，很多重要员工以辞职威胁西蒙斯，公司士气低落，西蒙斯最后只好拿下Mercer......</p><p>前面说过，公司文化是自由开放的，这是典型的Liberal文化。Mercer保守主义倾向当然是不大可取的，比如保守主义经常会导致小团体主义，没有自由派那种包容的文化。科研讲求开放合作，如果都是小团体主义，大家藏着掖着，或者领导有什么事只找几个亲信商量，这当然会打击大部分人的士气。</p><p>Simons himself contributed twenty-six million dollars in the 2016 election cycle—to liberal causes. He told me that he has always been a Democrat, because of the Party’s commitment to the poor. He sees no disconnect in paying the least possible in taxes while supporting a party that would like him to pay more.</p><p>最后是关于科研，西蒙斯现在搞了个研究所，资助科研50年，看看都是哪些领域吧。</p><p>The Flatiron Institute can be seen as replicating the structure that Simons established at Renaissance, where he hired researchers to analyze large amounts of data about stocks and other financial instruments, in order to detect previously unseen patterns in their fluctuations. These discoveries gave Simons a conclusive edge. At the Flatiron, a nonprofit enterprise, the goal is to apply Renaissance’s analytical strategies to projects dedicated to expanding knowledge and helping humanity. The institute has three active divisions—<b>computational biology, computational astronomy, and computational quantum physics</b>—and has plans to add a fourth.</p><p>Next came the<b> geosciences. </b>Simons lit up. He liked the complexity of the problems that needed to be solved. The institute could field-test the idea with a workshop, and it could include atmospheric science and ocean science, so that there was a connection to climate-change research. </p><p>大概就是计算生物、计算天文、计算量子物理，现在准备增加的是计算地理。共同点都是“计算”，看来科学计算、计算数学还是会有大发展的。大家如果想往这方面发展，可以申请斯坦福Computational and Mathematical Engineering的硕士或博士，当然这个program硕士是可以转博士的：</p><p><a href="https://icme.stanford.edu/">Institute for Computational &amp; Mathematical Engineering |</a></p><p><b>We Do Big Math.</b></p><p>In ICME, we conduct groundbreaking research, train and advise our <br>graduate students, provide consulting, and teach over 60 courses in <br>computational mathematics and scientific computing at both the <br>undergraduate and graduate level to the Stanford community. ICME has a <br>holistic approach to providing graduate students the course work, <br>research opportunities, support, and professional development to better <br>prepare them for their careers in scientific computing.  The Institute <br>is a home at Stanford for an increasingly critical multidisciplinary <br>field that uses advanced mathematical and computing capabilities to <br>understand and solve big, complex problems.</p><p>毕业之后无论是去文艺复兴还是西蒙斯新开的研究所Flatiron Institute 其实都是不错的选择~</p><p></p><p></p>
