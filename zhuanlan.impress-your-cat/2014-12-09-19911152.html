<p>感谢大家支持</p><p>以下是<a class="" data-title="youtube.com 的页面" data-editable="true" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRbY3TMUcgQ">Erlang The Movie II: The Sequel</a>的transcript。也就是专栏简介的出处。<br></p><blockquote><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Declarative programming languages have several advantages over
traditional languages. For example, programs in such languages are
considerably shorter than equivalent programs in imperative languages. Here for
example, is a program in C… and here is the equivalent program in Erlang.</p><p>[phone rings]</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Hello.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Hello Joe.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Hello Mike.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Question… does anyone care about the differences between
declarative and imperative languages anymore?</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Don’t be silly. The declarative/imperative debate is always a crowd
pleaser!</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> From what I can tell, kids these days are going with what’s cool,
like Node.js and Ruby on Rails. Let’s ask Robert.</p><p>[phone rings]</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Hello, Robert?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Hello Mike.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Joe’s back to talking about declarative languages again. I just think
Erlang’s got a problem when its spokesman is an old fuddy-duddy. Eh Joe?</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Bite me.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Robert, what do you think?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Erlang’s the shizzah! But I can’t blame kids for picking something a
little less… crusty.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Erlang’s image is stuck in the 1980s. It’s the Bananarama of languages.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Okay. Tell you what. This is bullshit. If kids these days don’t want
to use Erlang, which is the real “rock star tech” then fuck it. I’ll turn this
video off and go home. Take my nine nines with me!</p><p>[video turns off]</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Joe, I didn’t mean anything by it.</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Yeah Joe, Mike was just trying to be constructive.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Joe, turn the video back on.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> I won’t. I won’t have Erlang disparaged!</p><p>[stranger’s voice]</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Yo yo yo. I can totally help you geezers.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Who said that?</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> All Erlang needs is an image upgrade.</p><p>[video turns on]</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> That’s very interesting.</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Lots of things from the eighties are cool. Just look at Fraggle Rock
and Super Mario Brothers.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> What the hell is that?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> It’s one of those Ruby hipsters!</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Watch it grandpa. Just because I carry my Mac in a messager bag and
have great taste in nose rings doesn’t mean I use Ruby!</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> I for one and interested in what the little girl has to say.</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Yo, whatever. First we have to fix the name. A language named after a
nineteenth century Danish mathematician is about as cool as having a Facebook
account.</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> It’s just like the olden days, when Erlang was banned. We had to change
the name.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> That’s right. When Erlang fell out of fashion at Ericsson, we changed the name to OTP.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Three of the trendiest names we could think of: “open”, “telecom”,
“platform”.</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Gives me the chills just thinking about it.</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Okay, that’s bullcrap. No one care about telecom platforms. We need
something fresh. Something edgy.</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> Like “Erlang on Rails”!</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Jesus Christ. The last thing you want to do is imitate. No. Something
original.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> How about “Erlang++”?</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> I got it! We keep OTP, but with a hip, edgy twist. Check it. Your
language will hereby be known as “Outlaw Techno Psychobitch”!</p><p>[Joe scowls]</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> It does spell “OTP”.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Don’t know what it has to do with software. What do you think Joe?</p><p>[Joe pause]</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> I absolutely love it! That name is fucking gangster!</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Yeah Joe. You rule! Okay, next thing we need is a video that is just
as cool as the original Erlang The Movie, but speaks to today’s programmer
hipster. I’m thinking something like this…</p><p>[video starts]</p><p>“Outlaw Techno Psychobitch” - “OTP” - “Programming for Bad Ass Mother Fers!”</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> Yo, what up bitches. Rex here. This time I’m talking about a bad ass new
language called “Outlaw Techno Psychobitch”, or “OTP” for short.</p><p>So, you all know I’m a huge Ruby fan. Ruby gives you 15 ways to do the same
thing and freedom of choice is good. Then I realized, that’s just 15 different
ways to create really slow, crappy programs.</p><p>Then I started using Node.js. I like Node because, as my hero Ryan Dahl says,
“it’s like coloring with crayons and playing with Duplo blocks.” But as it
turns out, it’s less like playing with Duplo blocks and more like playing with
slinkies. Slinkies that get tangled together and impossible to separate.</p><p>So then I checked out Outlaw Techno Psychobitch. It’s a language out of Sweden
that can be used to build web scale, asynchronous, non-blocking, sharded, event
driven, message passing, NoSQL, reliable, highly available, high performance,
real time, clusterable, bad ass, rock star, get the girls, get the boys,
impress your mom, impress your cat applications!</p><p>Ryan Dahl, my hero, says “we should not be supporting more programming
languages,” that we should be “killing them”. That “all these bullshit projects
are confusing people.” But Psychobitch is just so damn cool, I couldn’t resist
giving it a try.</p><p>The first thing Psychobitch kills off is curly braces. Thank God. After a half
century of curly braces, we need something that’s fresh. Psychobitch uses
single character block delimiters, like in sentences.</p><p>My hero Ryan Dahl says, “math is not necessary,” that “people who think it’s
superior to curly braces are wrong.” But I figure, if math can get a rover to
Mars, maybe it can help us write better programs.</p><p>Psychobitch gets pretty uptight about logic. If you say X is one, then turn
around and say X is two, Psychobitch goes ape shit. She’s like, “what the hell,
when did one start equalling two?”</p><p>Psychobitch has this great feature called “pattern matching”. You define the
patterns and if there’s a match your program keeps going. If something doesn’t
match it crashes. Like assertions but built in.</p><p>What happens when your program crashes? Psychobitch has you covered. It
monitors your code and restart things that break. It’s like the Terminator. You
can blast it in the face with a shot gun — it stops for a second, then keeps
on coming!</p><p>I’ve written a chat server in Psychobitch. It’s where all my friends and me can
chat about how awesome Ryan Dahl is. Because the server is written in
Psychobitch, it can easily handle thousands of concurrent users. Shit, did I
say thousands? Because I meant tens of thousands. And by tens of thousands, I
mean hundreds of thousands.</p><p>[switch to demo]</p><p>I’m already logged in as myself at the top. I’ll log in as another user. You
say something using the “tell” command. The messages are received instantly
even though there are hundreds of thousands of connected users. I’ll use the
“yell” command to broadcast a message to every user.</p><p>[uses yell command]</p><p>That literally sent the message to 300,000 users. About a second.</p><p>Okay, 300,000 concurrent users is impressive. But even Node.js can do
that. Let’s try something hard. To make things interesting, we’ll trigger a bug
on the server.</p><p>[types a message and triggers a bug]</p><p>Damn. I must have said something bad. But as you can see, Mary and Jack can
still chat. Of the 300,000 users on the server, I’m the only one affected.</p><p>Let’s see if we can fix the bug. Here’s the code. Holy crap! It looks like the
original programmer, in his zeal, added some forbidden utterances. Let’s clean
this up because we don’t want to censor.</p><p>[fixed bug in code]</p><p>Okay, I recompiled the code. Next, I’ll reload it in real time with 300,000
concurrent chats going on.</p><p>[reloads code]</p><p>Done. In case you missed it, here it is again — in slow motion.</p><p>[reloads code, in slow motion]</p><p>For some of you, what you just saw is not self explanatory. If gracefully
handling bugs with hundreds of thousands of concurrent sessions and fixing them
in real time without stopping the server seems passe, you can aways use
Ruby. Then, when your app doesn’t scale, move to Node.js. Then, when you can’t
maintain your code because it’s a pile of tangled slinkies, move to
Psychobitch. With that experience you can appreciate what you just saw. For
the rest of you, yes, that just happened.</p><p>[video stops]</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> So, what do you guys think about Psychobitch?</p><p><strong>Robert:</strong> She’s utterly terrifying.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> It makes me wonder if perhaps Psychobitch is a real person.</p><p><strong>Rex:</strong> You mean, is the name based on my experience with a girlfriend who’s
bat shit crazy, drop dead gorgeous, brilliant, and brags to her friends about
costing me tens of thousands of dollars in therapy over the last three years?</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Oh shit. I know a girl like that. She scarred me for life,
literally. Seriously, I’ll show you the scars!</p></blockquote>
